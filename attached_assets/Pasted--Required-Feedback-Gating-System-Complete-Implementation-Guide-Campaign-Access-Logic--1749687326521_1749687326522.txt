│   improvement suggestion)    │

- brandsInfluenced: 8

```

## 🚨 Edge Case Handling

### User Resistance Management
```javascript
Common Objections & Solutions:

"I forgot to try it":
→ "No problem! Try it now and we'll wait 2 more hours"
→ Extend deadline by 24hrs (one-time per user)

"I didn't like it":
→ "That's valuable feedback! Tell us why (30 seconds)"
→ Show simplified 3-question survey for negative experiences

"Too busy right now":
→ "Quick 30-second version available"
→ Minimal survey: Rating + purchase intent only

"Product was broken/bad":
→ "Report issue" flow → bypass + investigation
→ Brand gets flagged, user gets immediate access to new campaigns
```

### Technical Safeguards
```javascript
System Protections:
- Prevent survey spam (one submission per product)
- Detect rushed responses (completion time < 30 seconds)
- Flag suspicious patterns (all 5-stars, identical text)
- Grace period for technical issues (app crashes, etc.)
- Manual override for customer service cases
```

## 📊 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)
```javascript
// Start with gentle reminders, no blocking
Settings: {
  blockingEnabled: false,
  remindersOnly: true,
  deadline: 7 days // generous for testing
}
```

### Phase 2: Gradual Enforcement (Week 2-3)
```javascript
// Enable blocking for new users only
Settings: {
  blockingEnabled: true,
  applyToExistingUsers: false,
  deadline: 72 hours,
  graceExtensions: 1 // allow one extension
}
```

### Phase 3: Full Enforcement (Week 4+)
```javascript
// Roll out to all users with optimized experience
Settings: {
  blockingEnabled: true,
  applyToAllUsers: true,
  categorySpecificDeadlines: true,
  smartExtensions: true // weekend/holiday logic
}
```

## 🎯 User Communication Strategy

```
❌ "You must complete review to continue"

✅ "Help brands improve & discover new products!"

❌ "Review overdue"
✅ "Share your experience to help others!"
```

## 🔧 Technical Database Structure
```sql
-- Feedback tracking
user_feedback_status (
  user_id,
  product_id, 
  claimed_at,
  deadline,
  completed_at,
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'bypassed'
)

-- Campaign access control
campaign_access_log (
  user_id,
  campaign_id,
  blocked_reason,
  blocked_at,
  resolved_at
)

-- Bypass tracking
feedback_bypasses (
  user_id,
  product_id,
  bypass_reason,
  bypass_type: 'safety' | 'technical' | 'lost' | 'admin',
  created_at
)
```

**This creates a virtuous cycle: Better feedback → Better products → Happier users → More engagement → Higher brand value → More partnerships! The key is making it feel like users are contributing to the community rather than jumping through hoops! 🌟**
