Creative Design & UX/UI Brief: Earlyshh “Partnership” Experience

1. Project Context
Earlyshh connects everyday Instagram users with DTC CPG brands via an exclusive Partnership Access. Users within a set radius receive a limited-edition digital pass, redeem a free product at participating retailers, and share a Story tagging the brand and Earlyshh to complete the experience. No “coupons”—this is about first-access, community participation, and authenticity.

2. Messaging Pillars
1. Exclusivity & First Access
   * Headline Example: “You’re Invited: Early Access to SuperRoot”
   * Convey that each offer is limited and handpicked—users feel part of an inner circle.
2. Mutual Partnership
   * Language: “Join the SuperRoot Partnership” vs. “Use your coupon.”
   * Emphasize that brands and users co-create buzz: “Share your first sip, we’ll share your story.”
3. Authentic Social Share
   * Clarify the requirement: posting an Instagram Story is the social “seal of approval” that unlocks the experience.
   * Tone: “Post a Story to confirm your partnership—no feed posts, only fleeting Stories.”
4. Community & Discovery
   * Highlight local neighborhood spirit: “Your neighborhood’s next big find”
   * Use “Discover,” “Unlock,” “Be the first” rather than “save” or “redeem.”

3. UX/UI Tone & Visuals
* Color Palette: l
* Typography:
   * Headlines: Bold, slightly condensed sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat SemiBold)
   * Body: Friendly, humanist sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Poppins)
* Imagery & Icons:
   * Lifestyle Shots: Real users in local shops, focusing on authentic moments, not staged coupon grabs
   * Icons: Simple line-icons with a “stamp” or “badge” motif for “Partnership Verified”
* Microcopy:
   * Buttons: “Unlock Partnership,” “Show Your Pass,” “Share Your Story”
   * Status Labels: “Partner Slot Remaining,” “Offer Expires: Jul 31,” “Story Pending Approval”

5. Interaction Patterns
* Fleeting vs. Permanent: Emphasize that the experience lives in Stories—no permanent feed clutter.
* Progress Indicators:
   * “Slots Remaining” badge on each card
   * “Story Pending” toast notifications
* Modal Flows:
   * Pass details in a bottom-sheet modal
   * Story prompt as a full-screen overlay

6. Next Steps for the Design Team
1. Moodboard & Style Tile:
   * Curate imagery and color/typography samples aligning with the premium-tech-local vibe.
2. Wireframes:
   * Sketch the screens above with placeholder copy and UI components.
3. Prototype:
   * Build a clickable Figma/Sketch prototype showcasing the partnership flow (Claim → Detail → Story → Confirm).
4. Usability Testing:
   * Validate microcopy and tone with a small group (5–7) of target users (18–34, IG-active).
