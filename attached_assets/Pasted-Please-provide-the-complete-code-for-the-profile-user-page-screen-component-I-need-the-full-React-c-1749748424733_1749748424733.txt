Please provide the complete code for the profile/user page screen component. I need the full React component code including:

**COMPLETE COMPONENT STRUCTURE:**
1. The main profile page component file and its location
2. All imports and dependencies used (React Query, hooks, UI components, icons, etc.)
3. Complete JSX structure including:
   - Header/navigation section
   - User profile information (avatar, name, stats, etc.)
   - User statistics/metrics (partnerships claimed, savings, streaks, etc.)
   - Achievement/badge sections if present
   - Settings or account management sections
   - Any gamification elements (levels, progress bars, etc.)
   - Action buttons (edit profile, settings, logout, etc.)
   - Bottom navigation if included

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
4. All styling (Tailwind classes and any custom CSS)
5. State management (useState, useEffect, React Query, etc.)
6. User data structures and mock data if present
7. Any profile editing functionality
8. Authentication/logout logic
9. Navigation/routing logic
10. API integration points

**FUNCTIONALITY:**
11. Profile image upload/editing
12. User preference settings
13. Partnership history access
14. Achievement display logic
15. Statistics calculation and display
16. Social features (if any)
17. Account management features

Please format it as a complete, copyable code block so I can share it with a designer for a complete redesign using our new elegant, colorful design system.

I want to update this profile page to match our premium partnership platform aesthetic with:
- Bright, vibrant background gradients (like our other pages)
- Prominent colorful UI elements and cards
- Partnership-focused language and terminology
- Modern card designs with backdrop blur effects
- Sophisticated animations and interactions
- Better visual hierarchy and contrast
- Gamification elements that feel premium
- Clean, spacious layout with proper depth layers

Show me everything currently implemented so I can plan the redesign strategy.
