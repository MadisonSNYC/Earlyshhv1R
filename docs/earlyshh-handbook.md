## 1. Company Overview

### Vision & Mission

Earlyshh's vision is to revolutionize product discovery and customer engagement by turning everyday consumers into authentic brand advocates. Our mission is to connect real people (not paid influencers) with brands they'll love, creating genuine local experiences that benefit everyone involved.

**Core Concept:** A location-based social sampling platform where users claim free products from brands, redeem them in-store within 500 feet, and share authentic experiences on Instagram Stories.

### Founding Story

Madison founded Earlyshh after too many disappointing dates filled with influencer-talk and close calls with aggressive street-sampling marketers. She decided brands and communities deserved better‚Äîa simpler, more sustainable, genuinely local way to connect. Her approach? Cut the influencer, eliminate the drama, and put products directly in the hands of real, present, everyday people.

### Founders

#### Madison Sutton - Founder & CEO

Madison founded Earlyshh to revolutionize how brands connect with real people. She is a systems strategist, AI consultant, and former top-producing real estate professional known for blending emotional intelligence with technical precision. After building a widely recognized career in NYC luxury real estate‚Äîwith over 100 press features in outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Forbes, CNN, and TIME‚Äîshe transitioned into a hybrid role at the intersection of automation, decision-making psychology, and digital identity.

Madison now helps founders, operators, and creative professionals architect smarter workflows, clarify their leadership voice, and integrate AI into their daily systems without losing the human side of their business. With 150,000+ followers across social media platforms, Madison brings deep expertise in social media strategy and community building. Known for her strategic clarity and grounded voice, she writes and speaks on topics like synthetic intimacy, decision fatigue, emotional resilience, and what it means to trust yourself in a hyper-automated world. She calls herself a Technical Perspective Architect‚Äîpart translator, part builder, part coach.

#### Rob Onslow - Co-Founder

Rob's our fintech and payments guru from London, with a knack for making complex financial stuff feel refreshingly simple. Before Earlyshh, he founded Bread, a platform making sure creators get paid fast‚Äîlike, next-day fast. Rob saw firsthand how tricky creator finances can get, so he's spent his career building easy solutions that give freelancers and creators some much-needed peace of mind. His extensive payment processing expertise and understanding of the influencer marketing payment ecosystem provides crucial infrastructure knowledge for Earlyshh's operations.

## 4. Business Model & Economics

### Revenue Structure [In Development]

Performance-based pricing model with multiple revenue streams:

| Revenue Stream | Description | Preliminary Thoughts |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Setup Fee | Per campaign setup and onboarding | $500-$2,000 depending on complexity |
| Per-Redemption Fee | Performance-based charge per successful redemption | $0.50-$2.00 per redemption |
| Analytics Package | Premium insights and reporting | $500/month for advanced analytics |
| White-Label Services | Custom branding for enterprise clients | $5,000+ setup + revenue share |

**Note:** These are preliminary pricing thoughts. Final pricing will be determined based on market research, competitor analysis, and pilot program results. We're comparing against traditional influencer campaigns ($1,000+ per post) and sampling programs to ensure competitive value.
